# simplicity vim colorscheme  

Extremely minimal vim colorscheme.  

It was quite difficult to use at first but took this as a challenge. After
a while I was actually very surprised on how this helped me focus more on 
how to read and write code. I'm now using this as my default colorscheme.  

Colors remain on comments, diff, directories, search, cursors, spelling, errors.
