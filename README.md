# simplicity vim colorscheme  

Extremely minimal vim colorscheme.  

It was quite a challenge to use at first, but after a while I was actually
very surprised on how this helped me focus on how to read and write code.
I'm now using this as my default colorscheme.  

Colors remain on comments, diffs, directories, searchs, cursor, spelling, errors.
